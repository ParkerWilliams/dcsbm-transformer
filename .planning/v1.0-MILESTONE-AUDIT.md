# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** gaps_found
**Score:** 40/61 requirements satisfied

## Executive Summary

The core analytical pipeline (Phases 1-7) is **complete and fully functional** — 280 tests pass, all cross-phase wiring is verified, and the system can generate DCSBM graphs, produce walk corpora, train transformers, evaluate behavioral outcomes with SVD collection, and perform predictive horizon analysis with rigorous statistical controls.

However, **3 phases remain unstarted** (8: Visualization, 9: Reporting, 10: Sweep Infrastructure), accounting for 21 unsatisfied requirements. Additionally, Phases 5 and 6 are missing formal VERIFICATION.md files (functional but unverified).

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Score:** 46/47 exports wired | 6/7 E2E flows complete

### Verified Connections (46)

All internal module-to-module wiring across phases 1-7 is verified:
- ExperimentConfig consumed by all 7 phases (10+ import sites)
- Graph/walk caching correctly keyed to config hash
- Model internals (QK^T, A, V, Wv, Wo) flow through Phase 6 SVD collection
- Phase 6 EvaluationResult fields feed Phase 7 analysis correctly
- RuleOutcome enum shared between Phases 6 and 7
- 280 tests pass confirming all wiring

### Missing Connection (1)

**run_experiment.py is a stub** (line 61-62): The CLI entry point only loads config (Phase 1). It does not call any Phase 2-7 functions. All internal wiring works — only the top-level orchestrator is missing. This is expected to be resolved in Phase 10 (Sweep Infrastructure).

### E2E Flow Status

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| ExperimentConfig through all phases | ✓ Complete |
| Graph/walk caching via config hash | ✓ Complete |
| Model internals to SVD collection | ✓ Complete |
| Phase 6 output to Phase 7 analysis | ✓ Complete |
| Phase 7 uses Phase 6 behavioral labels | ✓ Complete |
| Seed determinism propagation | ✓ Complete (via arithmetic offsets) |
| Full pipeline CLI (Config → Analyze) | ✗ Broken (run_experiment.py stub) |

## Tech Debt

### Process Gaps
- **Phase 5 (Training Pipeline):** Missing VERIFICATION.md — all 5 requirements listed as complete in SUMMARY.md and REQUIREMENTS.md but never formally verified
- **Phase 6 (Behavioral Eval + SVD):** Missing VERIFICATION.md — all 12 requirements listed as complete but never formally verified

### Code-Level Items
- `set_seed()` is exported from `src/reproducibility/` and tested but never called in any production code path — model weight initialization uses the unseeded global torch RNG
- Phase 6 → Phase 7 bridge (loading NPZ and constructing the dict for `run_auroc_analysis`) exists only in test code, not in any production script

## Test Suite

**Total: 280 tests, all passing**
- Phase 1: 46 tests (config, schema, reproducibility)
- Phase 2: 49 tests (graph generation, jumpers, cache)
- Phase 3: 18 tests (walk generator, corpus)
- Phase 4: 27 tests (transformer model)
- Phase 5: 52 tests (training, evaluation, pipeline)
- Phase 6: 44 tests (SVD metrics, behavioral, pipeline)
- Phase 7: 44 tests (event extraction, AUROC, statistical controls)

## Conclusion

The core research pipeline (Phases 1-7) is complete, tested, and cross-phase wired. The system can generate DCSBM graphs, train transformers, evaluate behavioral outcomes with SVD collection, and perform predictive horizon analysis with rigorous statistical controls.

Three phases remain: Visualization (8), Reporting (9), and Sweep Infrastructure (10). These are "consumer" phases that present and execute the analytical pipeline built in Phases 1-7.
