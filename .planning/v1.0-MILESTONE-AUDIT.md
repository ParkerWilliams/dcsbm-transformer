# v1.0 Milestone Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** gaps_found
**Score:** 32/61 requirements satisfied (17 partial, 12 unsatisfied)

## Executive Summary

Phases 1-9 have all been executed with code, tests, and SUMMARY files. However, the audit identifies three categories of gaps:

1. **Missing verifications (17 partial):** Phases 5, 6, and 8 lack VERIFICATION.md files. Phase 8 SUMMARYs also lack `requirements-completed` frontmatter.
2. **Unimplemented phase (4 unsatisfied):** Phase 10 (Sweep Infrastructure) has no directory, plans, or code.
3. **Integration breaks (6 issues):** The end-to-end pipeline orchestrator (`run_experiment.py`) is a stub, `set_seed` is never called in production, and `predictive_horizon` data is never written to result.json.

Phase 8 visualization requirements are classified as **unsatisfied** because neither VERIFICATION.md nor SUMMARY frontmatter provide a verification trail, despite code existing.

---

### Partial — Verification Gap (17 requirements)

SUMMARY frontmatter claims completion and REQUIREMENTS.md marked [x], but no VERIFICATION.md exists. Code likely exists and works but was never independently verified.

| REQ-ID | Phase | SUMMARY Claims | Issue |
|--------|-------|---------------|-------|
| TRNG-01 | 5 | 05-01-SUMMARY | Phase 5 missing VERIFICATION.md |
| TRNG-03 | 5 | 05-02-SUMMARY | Phase 5 missing VERIFICATION.md |
| TRNG-04 | 5 | 05-01, 05-02 | Phase 5 missing VERIFICATION.md |
| TRNG-05 | 5 | 05-02-SUMMARY | Phase 5 missing VERIFICATION.md |
| TRNG-06 | 5 | 05-02-SUMMARY | Phase 5 missing VERIFICATION.md |
| EVAL-01 | 6 | 06-02-SUMMARY | Phase 6 missing VERIFICATION.md |

| SVD-01 | 6 | 06-03-SUMMARY | Phase 6 missing VERIFICATION.md |
| SVD-02 | 6 | 06-01-SUMMARY | Phase 6 missing VERIFICATION.md |
| SVD-03 | 6 | 06-01-SUMMARY | Phase 6 missing VERIFICATION.md |
| SVD-04 | 6 | 06-03-SUMMARY | Phase 6 missing VERIFICATION.md; NPZ format conflict |
| SVD-05 | 6 | 06-01-SUMMARY | Phase 6 missing VERIFICATION.md |
| SVD-06 | 6 | 06-03-SUMMARY | Phase 6 missing VERIFICATION.md |
| SVD-07 | 6 | 06-01-SUMMARY | Phase 6 missing VERIFICATION.md |

### Unsatisfied (12 requirements)

#### Phase 8 — No Verification Trail (8 requirements)

Code exists (SUMMARYs describe completed work, tests pass) but neither VERIFICATION.md nor SUMMARY `requirements-completed` frontmatter exists. Per 3-source matrix: missing + missing = unsatisfied.

| REQ-ID | Issue |
|--------|-------|
| PLOT-01 | Event-aligned plots: code exists, no verification trail |
| PLOT-02 | Training curves: code exists, no verification trail |
| PLOT-03 | AUROC curves: code exists, never rendered (predictive_horizon data gap) |
| PLOT-04 | Confusion matrix: code exists, no verification trail |
| PLOT-05 | Distribution plots: code exists, no verification trail |
| PLOT-06 | Heatmap: code exists, requires sweep data from Phase 10 |
| PLOT-07 | Style baseline: code exists, no verification trail |
| PLOT-08 | Dual PNG/SVG: code exists, no verification trail |

#### Phase 10 — Not Implemented (4 requirements)

Phase 10 has no directory, plans, or code. Requirements are orphaned in the traceability table.

| REQ-ID | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| MGMT-02 | Parameter sweep with declarative definition |
| MGMT-03 | Priority-ordered job queue |
| MGMT-04 | 3 random seeds per configuration |
| MGMT-06 | Sweep state persistence for preemption recovery |

---

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Wiring Score:** 47/53 connections verified | 6 breaks found

### Critical Breaks

#### 1. No E2E Pipeline Orchestrator (P0)
`run_experiment.py:61-63` is a stub: `"[stub] Experiment execution not yet implemented (Phase 2+)."` Every phase provides well-defined public functions, but no code path chains them together. The pipeline is built but never assembled.

**Affects:** All phases 2-9 requirements at the integration level.

#### 2. `set_seed` Never Called in Production (P0)
`set_seed` is defined in `src/reproducibility/seed.py` and exported, but never called in any production code path. No production code seeds PyTorch, NumPy, or Python random from `config.seed`.

**Affects:** TRNG-02 (at integration level; the function itself works correctly per Phase 1 verification)

#### 3. `predictive_horizon` Never Written to result.json (P1)
Phase 5's `run_training_pipeline` writes result.json with only `scalars` and `curves`. Phase 7's analysis functions return structured dicts matching the schema, but nothing calls `fused_evaluate` → `run_auroc_analysis` → `apply_statistical_controls` and writes results back. Phase 8's `render_all` silently skips AUROC plots when `predictive_horizon` is empty.

**Affects:** PRED-01 through PRED-05, STAT-01 through STAT-05 (results never persisted), PLOT-03 (never rendered), REPT-01/02 (empty analysis sections)

#### 4. Incompatible NPZ Key Formats (P1)
`write_result` in `src/results/schema.py` uses `{seq_id}/{metric_name}` keys. `save_evaluation_results` in `src/evaluation/pipeline.py` uses `target.layer_N.metric_name` keys. `render_all` expects the latter. These two NPZ writers would produce conflicting key namespaces.

**Affects:** SVD-04, EVAL-05

### Non-Critical Issues

#### 5. Visualization `__init__.py` Exports Nothing (P2)
`src/visualization/__init__.py` contains only a docstring. All other phase packages export public API via `__all__`. Functions work via direct submodule imports but `from src.visualization import render_all` silently fails.

**Affects:** PLOT-01 through PLOT-08 (functional but inconsistent with other packages)

#### 6. Makefile `pdf` Target Is a Stub (P2)
`make pdf` prints "not yet implemented" despite Phase 9 fully implementing `generate_math_pdf` in `src/reporting/math_pdf.py`.

**Affects:** MATH-01, MATH-02 (function exists but `make pdf` does nothing)

### Verified Cross-Phase Wiring (47 connections)

| Connection | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Phase 1 ExperimentConfig → Phase 2/3/4/5/6 | Wired |
| Phase 1 graph_config_hash → Phase 2/3 cache keys | Wired |
| Phase 1 get_git_hash → result.json metadata.code_hash | Wired |
| Phase 1 write_result → Phase 5 training pipeline | Wired |
| Phase 2 GraphData/JumperInfo → Phase 3/5/6 | Wired |
| Phase 4 TransformerLM + ExtractionMode → Phase 6 SVD | Wired |

| Phase 8 load_result_data → Phase 9 reports | Wired |
| Phase 8 PALETTE → Phase 9 sparklines | Wired |
| Phase 9 reproduction block → result.json code_hash | Wired |

### Broken E2E Flows

| Flow | Break Point |
|------|-------------|
| Config → Graph → Walks → Train → Eval → Analyze → Viz → Report | `run_experiment.py` stub |
| Analysis → result.json → Visualization → Reporting | `predictive_horizon` never written |

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Items |
|-------|-------|
| Phase 5 | Missing VERIFICATION.md |
| Phase 6 | Missing VERIFICATION.md |
| Phase 8 | Missing VERIFICATION.md; SUMMARYs lack YAML frontmatter; `__init__.py` exports nothing |
| Phase 9 | Makefile `pdf` target is a stub; ROADMAP progress table outdated |
| Phase 10 | Entire phase not implemented; 4 requirements orphaned |

**Total: 10 tech debt items across 5 phases**
